A library for looking up and validating HTML5 entities.

[![Travis build](https://travis-ci.org/zudov/html5-entity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zudov/html5-entity) [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/html5-entity.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/html5-entity)



The [following](http://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/entities.json)
document is used as an authoritative source of the valid
entity names and their corresponding codepoints.

You can think of the library as about bindings to the data
in that file.

For usage see documentation on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/html5-entity/docs/Text-Html-Entity.html)
